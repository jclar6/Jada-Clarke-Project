<h2>My School</h2>
<p>I go to the University of New Haven in West Haven, CT. I am a Communications major with a concentration in TV/Video Production. I am also the Treasurer for the UNH Communications Club. I really enjoy my classes because they use hands-on learning. My favorite building on campus is Maxcy Hall.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>When I am not helping out at school I enjoy watching movies with my friends. Sometimes we have paint nights while listening to music. Occasionally, my friend will drive us to the mall and we look at the stores. When I'm by myself I like to watch YouTube videos or cook. Sometimes I'll practice my photography skills.</p>
